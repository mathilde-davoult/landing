			<p>When you sing, you also have to give off as much charisma and emotion. It's very important in the performance.</p>
			<p>I advise you to choose a sad song, it is one of the easiest emotions to imitate. Then, I will give you a secret kept by the biggest stars. Just before your performance, you have to cut an onion! This will cause tears to flow from your eyes, giving the impression that you are really crying with sadness. This is essential to convey the emotion of the performance. </p>
